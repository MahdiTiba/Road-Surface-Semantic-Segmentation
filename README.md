# Road-Surface-Semantic-Segmentation
 building U-Net Model on a self-driving car dataset.

 building a U-Net Model, a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, and using it to predict a label for every single pixel in an image - in this case, an image from a self-driving car dataset.
